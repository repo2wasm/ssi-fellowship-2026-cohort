# What do I do?

I work at GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, in Cologne, Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.

Part of my job is to lower the barrier for researchers to reproduce someone's computational work.

Unfortunately, the BinderHub operation team size is 5 volunteers. This translates into mybinder.org be down regularly.

A better solution, is to migrate mybinder.org to use JupyterLite.

## BinderHub vs JupyterLite

From the prespective of site reliability engineering (SRE),

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**BinderHub**

- Proxy
- Jupyter server
- Container
- Kubernetes
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**JupyterLite**

- Web server, like  Apache HTTP Server or Nginx.
:::

::: {.notes}
JupyterLite has a smaller list of dependencies.

This is not a new idea. It has been propose all the way back to 2022.
