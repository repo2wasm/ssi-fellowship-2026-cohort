# What do I do?

I work at GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, in Cologne, Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.

Part of my job is to lower the barrier for researchers to reproduce someone's computational work, this includes provide operation support to the BinderHub Federation.

## {background-image="./img/mybinder.org.png" background-size="cover" background-position="top"}

::: {.notes}
The BinderHub Federation provides a website where visitors can access a Jupyter environment with 1-click.
:::

## {background-image="./img/mybinder-launches.png" background-size="cover" background-position="top"}

::: {.notes}
The BinderHub Federation had a huge number of users between 2020 and 2022. This was possible thanks to financial support from Google. Even with the lost of financial support from Google, the platform continues to have a substantial number of daily users.

The big drop in daily users at the begin of 2022 was due the switch to JupyterLite for popular repositories.
:::

## {background-image="./img/discourse.jupyter.org.png" background-size="cover" background-position="top"}

::: {.notes}
Unfortunately, the BinderHub operation team size is 5 volunteers. This translates into the website be down regularly.
:::

## {background-image="./img/jupyterlite.png" background-size="cover" background-position="top"}

::: {.notes}
A better solution, is to help visitors to do the computation on their own devices. This is possible using JupyterLite.
:::

## JupyterLite

It is powered by WebAssembly (Wasm). Wasm adoption by industry has grow. In 2019, Solomon Hykes, a co-founder of Docker, wrote on Twitter (now X)

> If WASM+WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn't have needed to create Docker. That's how important it is.

## {background-image="./img/binderlite.png" background-size="cover" background-position="top"}

::: {.notes}
This is not a new idea. It has been propose all the way back to 2022.
:::

## {background-image="./img/repo2jupyterlite.png" background-size="cover" background-position="top"}

::: {.notes}
Some work was done but the project stop in earlier 2023.

## BinderHub vs BinderLite

From the prespective of site reliability engineering (SRE),

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**BinderHub**

- Proxy
- Jupyter server
- Container
- Kubernetes
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**BinderLite**

- Web server, like  Apache HTTP Server or Nginx
- JupyterLite
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
BinderLite has a smaller list of dependencies.

## My plans for the Fellowship

Promote JupyterLite and the idea of BinderLite as a replacement for the free offering from the BinderHub Federation at

- Q1/2026: German RSE Conference
- Q2/2026: Collaborations Workshop
- Q3/2026: UseR! + RSECon
- Q4/2026: CodeCheck meeting

## Q1/2026

:::: {.columns}

## Q4/2026

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
As a collaboration with creators of [CODECHECK](https://codecheck.org.uk/), Stephen Eglen (SSI fellow) and Daniel NÃ¼st, the organisation of a meeting in Cambridge, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ to promote

- the use of JupyterLite to speed up code check
- JupyterLite as "reproduction package" format.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Output**

Draft of white paper on ways that publishers can use BinderLite to offer reproducibility to readers without major changes in their software infrastructure.

::::

## After the Fellowship {background-image="./img/background-after-fellowship.png" background-size="cover" background-position="top"}

- Have BinderLite as a official offer at mybinder.org
- Explore the adoption of JupyterLite as "reproduction package" by some academic journals, e.g. <br> OJS, openRxiv, eLife.
